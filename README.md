# Lab 23

Our goals for today are to get some more practice with defining new classes, as well as practicing writing getter/setter methods and some basic inheritance.

I kept this lab pretty general, which meant that I could not really write auto-tests for it. As such, you are responsible for testing out your code to make sure it is behaving as desired! I gave you some basic guidelines to help out in the write-up.
